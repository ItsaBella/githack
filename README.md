# githack
This library was created as an example to test my understanding on how to publish a python package.

## The package contains two modules each with its own functions defined inside.
### Recursive functions
In this module we have defined a few recursion functions.
- sum_array: returns the sum of all items in an array
- fibonacci: returns the nth term in fibonacci sequence
- factorial: returns the nth factorial
- reverse: returns word in reverse

### Sorting algorithms
In this module we define a few sorting functions.
- bubble_sort: returns array of items sorted in ascending order
- merge_sort: returns array of items sorted in ascending order
- quick_sort: returns array of items sorted in ascending order
